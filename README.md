# Data Analysis with Python Course Projects
This reposiotry has the solutions of required projects to complete course provided by freecodecamp.com
* Used libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Mean-Variance-Standart Deviation Calculator 
In this project, I created a simple function that uses numpy to calculates  mean, variance, std,
min, max and sum of rows colomns and element and returns as 3x3 matrix.

## Demographic Data Analyzer
In this challenge analyze demographic data using Pandas. We are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database and perform certain operations that levels-up pandas skills.

## Medical Data Visiualizer
In this project, we visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations. he rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices.

## Page View Time Series Visualizer
For this project I visualized time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

## Sea Level Predictor
I analyzed a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. I used the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050. To show my predictions and past data reflection I plot it in simple sea-level, year x-y plot.
